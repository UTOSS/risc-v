# risc-v
UTOSS' starter multicycle RISC-V core.

## Development

Put new modules into `src/` folder.

### Formatting

We use SVLint to make sure our SystemVerilog code is well formatted. Use the following command to
check for new offences:
```
$ make svlint
```

### Testbenches

It is important that new functionality is tested to a reasonable extent by using test benches. To
run all existing testbenches use `make run_tb`

To create a new test bench, if you are on Linux use the following command:
```
$ make new_tb name="something"
```

If you are on Windows, create a new testbench file in `test/` folder named `something_tb.sv` (the
`_tb.sv` suffix and extension are necessary for the test suite to recognize this file as a
testbench). Copy the content of `test/tb_template.sv.m4` into your newly-created testbench file and
start writing the test bench.
